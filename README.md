# missiondb

## Briefly
This is the supporting project for []eMission](https://github.com/alfille/emission), a database system for keeping track of medical mission care. 

## History
Originally missiondb hosted the application, but a better name __eMission__ with an available domain name [eMissionSystem](https://emissionsystem.org) was selected. The [eMission repository](https://github.com/alfille/emission) now hosts the application and this site hosts supporting documentation and scripts for backend management.

## Inspiration
Dr. Gennadiy Fuzaylov, a pediatric anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and veteran of over 60 medical missions to the Ukraine, Columbia and found keeping track of patients, procedures and results was increasingly difficult.

A spreadsheet was not adequate -- poor phone interface, poor support for images, poorly multiuser and problematic security. Hence this project was born.
